# case-simulator

Case Simulator was essentailly a gambling simulation game. There were no plans of having micro-transactions, because I don't like to scam people out of their money when they could spend it on needs and things.

This was meant to be a game where you just opened cases and sold the skins you got out of those cases. I did plan to add things like multiplayer modes where the better skins you had the better chance you had of winning a 1v1. It was purely just a prototype though because I was over the moon with the scope and I let it change constantly when I should've just stuck to making it one contained gameplay style.

It was fun for me to make though, looking back through the code from time to time is kinda nice to do. I tried to make everything somewhat readable.

I'm pretty sure this version of the game is broken because I wanted to make every menu in the game controlled by one script. This wasn't a smart idea as each different menu was made to have its own script. Let's just say I learned my lesson. All you can really do in this game is just open a case (of your choice) and sell the skin you get. You don't really lose money because it isn't a balanced game but just a tech demo of a decent game.
